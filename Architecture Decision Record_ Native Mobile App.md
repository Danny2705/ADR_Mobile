# Architecture Decision Record: Native Mobile App
## Status
Accepted
## Context
Our team is tasked with developing a new mobile application for a retail company. To meet the requirements of seamless performance and user experience on mobile devices, the decision has been made to develop a native mobile application. This strategic choice aims to prioritize an exceptional user experience and seamless performance on Android devices. By opting for native development on Android, our team can harness platform-specific features, guaranteeing efficient offline support and an enhanced user interface
## Rationale
- Pros:
-- **Optimal User Experience**: Native development ensures a seamless and platform-specific user experience on Android devices.
-- **Efficient Offline Support**: Platform-specific features allow for efficient implementation of offline mode, aligning with the retail company's requirement.
-- **Enhanced Performance**: Direct access to Android-specific APIs and functionalities enhances overall app performance.

- Cons:
-- **Separate Development Teams**: Developing separate codebases for iOS and Android may require dedicated development teams, potentially increasing development efforts 
-- **Cost**: Maintaining and updating two separate codebases can be costlier than a cross-platform solution.

## Consequences
The decision to opt for a native mobile application comes with both substantial advantages and challenges. While users can expect an application that performs exceptionally well and integrates seamlessly with their devices, the development team must navigate the complexities of maintaining two separate codebases. Balancing these considerations will be crucial for delivering a high-quality mobile app that meets the retail company's requirements and user expectations.
