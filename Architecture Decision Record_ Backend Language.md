# Architecture Decision Record: Backend Language
## Status
Accepted
## Context
Selecting the appropriate backend language is crucial for handling real-time updates, asynchronous operations, and ensuring scalability. We have chosen Node.js as the backend language. Node.js is well-suited for handling asynchronous operations, making it suitable for scenarios with real-time updates, such as push notifications. Its non-blocking I/O model aligns with the app's requirements for efficient data synchronization and handling multiple concurrent connections.
## Rationale
- Pros:
-- **Asynchronous Operations**: Node.js is well-suited for handling asynchronous operations, crucial for real-time updates.
-- **Non-Blocking I/O**: Non-blocking I/O model aligns with the app's requirements for efficient data synchronization.
-- **Consistency**: JavaScript is commonly used in both frontend and backend, promoting code consistency.

- Cons:
-- **Learning Curve**: Developers unfamiliar with JavaScript on the server side may face a learning curve.
-- **Community Support**: While growing, the Node.js community may not be as extensive as some other backend languages.

## Consequences
- Choosing a native approach may involve longer development timelines and potentially higher costs.
- React Native simplifies cross-platform development but may require additional effort for platform-specific features.
- Node.js, while powerful for real-time operations, may pose a learning curve for developers new to JavaScript on the server side. The benefits in terms of consistency and scalability, however, outweigh this drawback.
