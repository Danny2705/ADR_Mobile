# Architecture Decision Record: UI Framework Selection
## Status
Accepted
## Context
The choice of a UI framework significantly impacts development efficiency and the consistency of the user interface. Our team needs to decide on the most appropriate UI framework for the mobile app development. We have selected the React Native framework for the UI. React Native enables the development of cross-platform applications with a single codebase while maintaining native-like performance. This aligns with our decision to go for a native app, and React Native provides a balance between development efficiency and native user experience.
## Rationale
- Pros:
-- **Development Efficiency**: Faster development cycles due to hot-reloading and code reusability.
-- **Native-Like Performance**: Provides a native-like user experience.

- Cons:
-- **Platform-Specific Features**: Some advanced platform-specific features may require additional effort.
-- **Community Libraries**: Availability of certain libraries may be limited compared to native development.

## Consequences
Choosing React Native as the UI framework brings the advantage of efficient cross-platform development. However, it may require additional effort for implementing certain platform-specific features. While React Native's community is robust, there might be limitations in terms of available libraries compared to the extensive ecosystem of native development. Overall, the decision aims to strike a balance between development efficiency and achieving a native-like user experience.
